        Sleeping well directly affects your mental and physical health.It can take a
         serious toll on your daytime energy, productivity, emotional balance, and even your weight. 
         Yet many of us regularly toss and turn at night, struggling to get the sleep we need.
<br>
        Getting a good night’s sleep may seem like an impossible goal when you’re wide awake at 3 a.m., 
        but you have much more control over the quality of your sleep than you probably realize.
         Just as the way you feel during your waking hours often hinges on how well you sleep at night, so the cure for sleep 
         difficulties can often be found in your daily routine.
        <br>
        Unhealthy daytime habits and lifestyle choices can leave you tossing and turning at night and adversely affect
         your mood, brain and heart health, immune system, creativity, vitality, and weight. But by experimenting with the following tips,
         you can enjoy better sleep at night, boost your health, and improve how you think and feel during the day.
         Try to go to sleep and get up at the same time every day. This helps set your body’s internal clock and optimize the quality of your sleep. Choose a bed time when you normally feel tired, so that you don’t toss and turn. If you’re getting enough sleep, you should wake up naturally without an alarm. If you need an alarm clock, you may need an earlier bedtime.

Avoid sleeping in—even on weekends.
 The more your weekend/weekday sleep schedules differ, the worse the jetlag-like symptoms you’ll experience.
  If you need to make up for a late night, opt for a daytime nap rather than sleeping in. 
  This allows you to pay off your sleep debt without disturbing your natural sleep-wake rhythm.
 <br>
Be smart about napping. While napping is a good way to make up for lost sleep, 
if you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep at night, napping can make things worse.
 Limit naps to 15 to 20 minutes in the early afternoon.
<br>
Start the day with a healthy breakfast. Among lots of other health benefits,
 eating a balanced breakfast can help sync up your biological clock by letting your body know that it’s time to wake up and get going. 
 Skipping breakfast on the other hand, can delay your blood sugar rhythms, lower your energy, and increase your stress,
  factors that may disrupt sleep.
<br>
Fight after-dinner drowsiness. If you get sleepy way before your bedtime,
 get off the couch and do something mildly stimulating, such as washing the dishes, calling a friend, or getting clothes ready for the next day.
 If you give in to the drowsiness, you may wake up later in the night and have trouble getting back to sleep.
